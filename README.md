Music album collection system to store the song names of the music albums in a particular collection. For each music album, store its artist, its title, its year, and its list of songs. In  implementation, the collection of music albums and the list of songs in each music album is implemented using dynamically allocated arrays. The assignment has two parts whose requirements are explained below.
 
## Part A

It stores the artists, titles, and years of music albums in a collection without their list of songs. The music albums will be stored in a dynamically allocated array of MusicAlbum objects. 

## Part B

Now, Part A is to be extended such that each music album has a list of songs. The full functionality of this extended MAC system is to be provided. In order for this to be done, the MusicAlbum class needs to be extended such that it additionally keeps the list of songs contained. The song list of a music album must be kept in a dynamically allocated array of Song objects. Note that the number of songs can be different from one music album to another, but is normally fixed for a particular music album.
